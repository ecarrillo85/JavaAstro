# JavaAstro
This project is being worked on for a Java programming class. 

All functions work, with the exception of fileUp function. 
That function is meant to upload a file from the harddrive 
to the site.

What the user needs...

The user needs to get an api key from http://nova.astrometry.net/
once that has been acquired, the user can then input the api key into
the proper function and all working functions will be available.

Things that need to be done...

Get the fileUp function working and create a gui for the program.
